# Tableau Projects

I have done these below projects by using Tableau Software.
I've made various comparisions on each dataset and also created a Dashboard.
Various charts are used in these projects such as *Pie Chart*, *Bar Chart*, *Line Chart*, *Donut Chart*, *Heat Map*, *Bubble Chart* etc..
Each folder contains the ***Dataset(csv file)***, ***Dashboard Image(png)***, ***Dashboard FiLe(pdf)*** and ***Tableau Workbook***
