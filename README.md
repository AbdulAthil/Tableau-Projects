# Tableau Projects
I have done these above projects by using Tableau Software.
I've made various comparisions on each dataset and also created a Dashboard.
Various charts are used in these projects such as
### *Pie Chart*
### *Bar Chart*
### *Line Chart*
### *Donut Chart*
### *Heat Map*
### *Bubble Chart* etc..
Each folder contains the Dataset(csv file), Dashboard png image, Dashboard pdf file and **Tableau Workbook**
